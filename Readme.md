## Running

1. Install `vagrant` for your system from http://downloads.vagrantup.com/
2. `vagrant plugin install vagrant-reload` to install the reload plugin so that we can reload the VM where needed during provisioning.
3. Install `virtualbox` for your system from https://www.virtualbox.org/
4. `vagrant up` from the root of the project to build and start a virtual machine running the application.
